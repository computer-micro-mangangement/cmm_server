# CMM - Server
This is the heart of CMM (Computer Micro Management) without this running in your network, wether locally or globally, our systems won't work. This whole organisation is for one purpose only: Let the user manage and monitor their Computer from non-localhost. <br>
The other projects in this organisation are part of the an ecosystem-like structure and can be installed on all computers you want to mangage. THe server will only run on one machine only. Every project is modular or rather fully indepentent from one another, but every module will communicate with the same server. In the future there might be a hub you can install on your system to mangage all modules on that machine.

Here a quick sumnmary of all (future) modules:<br>
**_required:_** [CMM Server](https://github.com/computer-micro-mangangement/cmm_server)<br>
[CMM Hub](https://github.com/computer-micro-mangangement/cmm_hub) (not avialable yet)<br>
[CMM Notifier](https://github.com/computer-micro-mangangement/cmm_notifier) (in transition from indepentent to cmm-module) (this is a module wich will enable you to send notification to specific machines on your managed-network)<br>
[CMM Monitor](https://github.com/computer-micro-mangangement/cmm_monitor) (not avialable yet) (module to monitor your PC's performance (similar to the "Task Manager"(win), "top"(lin), "htop"(lin), etc.))<br>
